Sales Prediction Using Linear Regression

This code is a basic example of how to predict future sales using a simple linear regression model in Python. It assumes you have historical sales data to train the model and then use it to predict future sales.

Usage:

Data Preparation:

Ensure you have a CSV or other data file containing historical sales data.
Replace 'your_data.csv' in the code with the actual filename of your data file.
Examine your data to understand its structure. The code assumes a dataset with at least two columns: 'date' and 'sales'. You can add more features to improve predictions.
Data Preprocessing:

The code loads the data and extracts 'date' as the feature (X) and 'sales' as the target variable (y).
Split the data into training and testing sets.
Model Building:

It creates a simple linear regression model using scikit-learn.
The model is trained on the training data using the fit method.
Predictions:

The code makes predictions on the testing data and visualizes the results using matplotlib.
You can visualize how well the model fits your historical data by plotting the actual sales against the predicted sales.
Future Sales Prediction:

To predict future sales, provide a future date in the format YYYY-MM-DD in the future_date variable.
The model will predict the sales for that specific date.
Customization:

You can extend this model by adding more features to improve prediction accuracy, such as marketing spend, seasonality, or other relevant data.
You can explore other machine learning algorithms for regression to find the best-fit model for your data.
Note:

This code provides a simple starting point for sales prediction. In practice, you may need to adapt it to your specific data and requirements.
